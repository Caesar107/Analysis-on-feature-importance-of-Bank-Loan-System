This research explores the application of advanced data mining techniques, particularly the XGBoost algorithm, for credit risk assessment in the banking industry. While traditional methods like logistic regression have been widely adopted, they exhibit limitations in accurately identifying potential loan defaults, especially in minority risk groups. Through a comprehensive evaluation of four models - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, decision tree, and XGBoost - on a common dataset, this study aims to identify the optimal
algorithm for credit scoring. The methodology involves data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning using randomised search cross-validation, and extensive performance evaluation metrics. The findings demonstrate the superiority of the XGBoost
model, achieving 94% accuracy, 0.96 precision, and 0.74 recall in predicting loan defaults, outperforming baseline models. Integrating techniques like SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), critical factors influencing creditworthiness predictions are unveiled, such as
the loan-to-income ratio, renting status, and loan purpose. This research contributes to optimising credit risk assessment processes, enabling more accurate and personalised loan strategies while addressing the shortcomings of previous literature in developing hybrid models and handling imbalanced data.
